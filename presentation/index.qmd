## What is CI/CD? 


::: {.fragment}
* Continuous Integration (CI): Frequent merging of several small changes into a main branch
:::

::: {.fragment}
* Continuous Delivery (CD): Repeatable deployment process when deciding to deploy
:::

::: {.fragment}
CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by **enforcing automation** in building, testing and deployment of applications. CI/CD services compile the incremental code changes made by developers, then link and package them into software deliverables

## How does CI/CD help R packages?

::: {.incremental}
- Catch issues (bugs) early on 
- User base on multiple OSes and multiple R versions
- Faster turnaround on Code Review
- Multiple Contributors on your R Package
- Enforce style conventions and preferences 
- Measure test coverage for new code 
- Keep docs up-to-date
- And we can just keep going!

## Issue 1 - How to Check our Template Code

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%" .incremental}
- Create a reference files to build common ADaM datasets that shows users how to implement our functions
- Way less text than a Vignette - Code is ready to go and build a dataset
- Where we store this code is not checked by R-CMD
- How to ensure code stays up to date with deprecated functions or unforeseen bugs get in from functions working together?
- CI/CD for the win!

## Solution 1 - CI/CD for Templates

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- Dedicated CI/CD workflow that executes the Template code
- Once a Code Review is completed the `Check Template` Workflow is executed
- If any errors or warnings are detected the CI/CD check fails and the contributor must fix the error or warning.

<!-- ## Package Development Problems
<br/>
- Lots of co-dependent packages that need to be tested as a cohort
- Testing Shiny web applications based on the `teal` framework
- Deploying Shiny web applications built with `teal`
- Validation of all packages to
  - adhere to regulatory standards
  - so they can be deployed on regulatory compute environments
::: {.centre}

::: -->




## Use Case 1 - Testing Packages as a Cohort

<br/>


- An in-development package must be tested against the latest versions of upstream dependencies
- Monorepo emulation via a git branch naming strategy is achieved by using
  - the [staged.dependencies R package](https://github.com/openpharma/staged.dependencies)
  - and the [staged.dependencies GitHub Action](https://github.com/insightsengineering/staged-dependencies-action)
- Testing as a cohort can be done at any stage (eg. development, pre-release, release)

## Use Case 2 - Shiny App Testing & Deployment

<br/>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

- Analysts create Shiny web apps via the `teal` framework for analyzing data
- Apps are tested via a CI pipeline that uses the [`shinytest2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinytest2/index.html) R package
- Apps deployed to an RSConnect Server instance via a CD pipeline
  - With the help of the [`rsconnect`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsconnect/index.html) and [`connectapi`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/connectapi/index.html) R packages

## Use Case 3 - Validating R Packages

<br/>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- R packages are validated by an internal validation team that uses CI/CD pipelines to automatically
  - accept new package submissions via a form
  - running tests against the new package to ensure package integrity
  - enforcing criteria to ensure that the package meets regulatory requirements
- Also validated externally via an open source project called [thevalidatoR](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR)

::: {.notes}
Key component of the package is that many of the methods rely on resampling techniques to 
generate confidence intervals. This requires fitting potentially 1000's of MMRM models which
means run times tend to be in the order of minutes to hours for a full run of the package
depending on the size of the data
:::






## Package Development Problems
<br/>

- Installation takes >3 minutes to compile STAN code
- Full test suite takes >50 minutes to run
- Vignettes took >5 minutes to run
- Need to release on in-house servers running legacy versions of R
- Many PR's forgot to run `devtools::document()`
- Many PR's forgot to rebuild pkgdown site

<div class="centre">
![](images/sad-emoji.png)
</div>

::: {.notes}
2 key issues that we are about to cover:
- Need to get run times down to <10 minutes
- Need to ensure package works both on internal server and CRAN
:::






## Solution 1 - Reducing the Test Suite Runtime
<br/>

::: {.file-name}
`tests/testthat/test-bigtest.R`
:::
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
test_that("Some long running section", {
  skip_if_not(Sys.getenv("R_TEST_FULL") == "TRUE")

  # <rest of the test code>
})
```

<br/>

::: {.fragment}
::: {.file-name}
`.github/workflows/on_biweekly.yaml`
:::
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 4 1,15 * *'

jobs:
  rcmdcheck-main:
    env:
      R_TEST_FULL: 'TRUE' 
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Check
        uses: ./.github/actions/rcmdcheck
```
:::

::: {.notes}
- Use of skip-if-not + environment variable to conditionally control which tests get executed
- Use of CICD to ensure that the skipped tests do still get run on a period basis
:::




## Solution 2 - Reducing the Vignette Runtime

<br/>



```text
.
├── DESCRIPTION
├── R/
├── tests/
└── vignettes/
    ├── quickstart.Rmd
    ├── quickstart.html
    └── quickstart.html.asis
```
<br/>

::: {.file-name}
`DESCRIPTION`
:::
```{bash}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE 
Suggests: R.rsp
VignetteBuilder: R.rsp
```

<br/>


::: {.file-name}
`vignettes/quickstart.html.asis`
:::
```{bash}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE 
%\VignetteIndexEntry{rbmi: Quickstart}
%\VignetteEngine{R.rsp::asis}
```

::: {.notes}
- Use of R.rsp package  to use "asis" vignette builder
- This is where we make the vignettes locally in advance and directly add them to the repo
- When R "builds" the vignette it simply just uses the pre-built file asis without re-running it
- This opens up a problem though of how do we know if the vignette is up-to-date or even runs properly
anymore?
:::


## Solution 2 - Reducing the Vignette Runtime {visibility="uncounted"}

<br/>


::: {.file-name}
`.github/workflow/on_pr.yaml`
:::
```yaml
  vignettes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: "ghcr.io/insightsengineering/rbmi:latest"
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build Vignettes
        run: |
          Rscript ./vignettes/build.R
```


::: {.centre}
![](images/github-vignette-ticks.png)
:::

::: {.notes}
- We thus have a dedicated CICD job specifically to re-build the vignette. 
- This way Vignette execution is doing in parallel to the running of the test suite
- Trade off here though is that it means our vignettes are never executed on CRANs servers
- This trade-off can be partially mitigated by setting up our own CICD process to use a variety of
different OS's / machine builds
:::




<!-- ## Solution 3 - Reducing code Compilation Time
<br/>

::: {.file-name}
`.github/actions/build-src/action.yml`
:::
```yaml
    - name: Cache Compiled Stan Code
      id: cache-pkgs
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: src/*
```

::: {.centre}
![](images/github-cache-build.png){style="height:350px"}
:::

::: {.notes}
- Main point is compiling code (in our case stan code) can take a ton of time
- We use githubs cache feature to restore the compiled code from previous builds to save that time
- Con is that care with the configuration is required to ensure you aren't loading say MAC binaries
on a windows image
- Screenshot just shows the run time of the compile code "build src" is very low compared to the 
usual 2-5 minutes
::: -->



## Solution 3 - Testing Against In-House Servers
<br/>

::: {.centre}
![](images/rbmi-docker-image.png){style="height:600px"}
:::

::: {.notes}
- Use of docker files to emulate our in-house servers
- Had double benefit of drastically reducing package install times on standard push / pr builds
as all required dependencies are already installed and ready to go
:::


<!-- ## Solution 4 - Testing Against In-House Servers {visibility="uncounted"}
<br/>

::: {.file-name}
`.github/workflows/build_docker.yaml`
:::
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'misc/docker/**'

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository 
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
      
      - name: Build and push image 
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
```
::: {.notes}
- Main point here is the targeted use of "paths" to only rebuild and redeploy our docker images
when a change has occurred in the docker directory
- The Job code is pretty redundant here as it misses a load of stuff to ensure if can fit on the 
screen however hopefully it just gives some flavour of a job to build a docker file
::: -->




## Solution 3 - Testing Against In-House Servers {visibility="uncounted"}
<br/>

::: {.file-name}
`.github/workflows/on_pr_main.yaml`
:::

```yaml
jobs:
  rcmdcheck:
    strategy:
      matrix:
       config:
        - { image: "ghcr.io/insightsengineering/rbmi:r404"}
        - { image: "ghcr.io/insightsengineering/rbmi:r410"}
        - { image: "ghcr.io/insightsengineering/rbmi:latest"}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ${{ matrix.config.image }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Build src
        uses: ./.github/actions/build-src
        
      - name: Check
        uses: ./.github/actions/rcmdcheck
```

::: {.notes}
- Final bit on this is just to highlight that we can use githubs matrix feature
to ensure that our job is run against all the different combination of images and r versions
that we want to ensure we can support

## Need to ensure code works on internal servers

DockerFile that emulates internal servers + cicd job to ensure code works in it
 

## CRAN limits runs to 10 minutes

- Extract vignettes to "as-is" instead of being built on the fly
- CICD test to then re-build vignettes to make sure they don't error  (rather than being done in the CRAN-check)
- Extraction of long running unit tests into their own "extended" set of tests
- CRON CICD job that will run the extended unit tests (which last an hour) whilst regular set of unit tests run fine in a couple of minutes


## Unit tests take a long while to run due to the need to compile code

Cache the src/ directory so that it is restored on each run (cache done separately per OS / R-version

## Testing

### Unit Tests

1. Unit Tests: 
2. Test Coverage:
3. Integration tests:

## Static Code Analysis

1. Linting
2. Spell Check
3. Link & URL Checks

## Documentation

1. Man pages
2. pkgdown site
